## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Objective 
The problem is mostly Content Publishers don't have good revenue in a decentralized environment, to solve this we're building a RayoCity in Metaverse - the next big thing in Blockchain. We are just building this as a Blockchain Game to create a Visual Appeal, in the RayoCity community, there will be Players, Publishers, and Developers, these people will get benefitted through game incentives and earning through self-published content.

### Brief Description
RayoCity is a modern-day Simulation Game on Blockchain where users can earn, build, own, trade, and explore a Virtual City. It is a complete Universe, this Virtual city has everything, it has a Shopping mall, Airport, Library, Bank, Sports Complex, and a lot more. Users can visit a Shopping mall to purchase & trade NFT's, play arcade games to get incentives (Play-to-Earn). 

They can go anywhere in the city and do whatever they want to do. Users can also visit a Central library where they can buy or sell E-books and they can also publish their own content. If a user sells a book another user can buy that book within this library through RCTY tokens. Also, people can purchase/rent a shop in the Shopping Mall and Airport where they can create their own stores. 


### Project Details


- [Whitepaper](https://docs.rayocity.com)
- Technology stack
  1. Frontend - React, HTML Phaser
  2. Smart Contract - Solidity
  3. API's - Serverless (AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions)
  4. Play-to-Earn Games - HTML Phaser, WebGL
- Additional Information
  1. The Game UI/UX will be top-view 2D design
  2. There will be different smart contracts deployed based on the functions


### Ecosystem Fit

- As we mentioned the major problem faced by Content publishers we are on a mission to solve it by Gamification. The main Obstacle is that our idea is really big which can't happen overnight it takes a lot of hard work, time, and patience to build a Universe like RayoCity if you have checked our Whitepaper, you know about what we're building. As our project is going to be in the Metaverse still people do not what it is all about, but once if they started entering into our ecosystem everyone will understand the needs of gamification.
 
- Our Target Audience
   - Gamers
   - Crypto Enthusiasts 
   - Content Publishers 
   - Developers
- The core issue our project will solve is the transparent revenue system for the Content Publishers
- Currently our project is very unique and we are not a regular Blockchain/NFT Game, we are on a mission to solve the above mentioned problem
